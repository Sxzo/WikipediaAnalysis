## Repository Structure

Our data comes from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html. It is a set of links between Wikipedia articles that were used by people in the game Wikispeedia. The files are `links.tsv` and `articles.tsv` in the `/data` folder.

Our project documents, including the log, team contract, and project proposal, are found in the `/documents` folder.

The library that we used to create the PNG/GIF for our visualization is found in the `/lib` folder.

Our tests are found in the `/tests` folder.

Our graph and algorithm implementations are found in the `/src` folder.

Our `main.cpp` file that is the entrypoint into the program is found in the `/entry` folder.

## Running instructions

The first thing that you need to do is `cd build` in the terminal, and type `cmake ..`.

### Main
To run the main function, type `make main` and then `./main`. From there, follow the directions given in the terminal.
This will enter a sequence to test dijkstras and BFS. (NOTE: These functions will only function correctly with valid inputs). 

### Tests
To run our tests, type `make test`, and then `./test`.
