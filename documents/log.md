# 10/31/2022 - 11/04/2022
**Weekly goals:**  
  Write project proposal  
  Write team contract  
  Create GitHub repository  
  
 ### **Tasks completed:**
  
  Created GitHub repo - Joe T
  
  Created and filled out team contract, project proposal, and log documents - Everyone

### **Problems encountered:**

  We had a little bit of trouble finding a data set that we could use for the ideas we had and thinking of ideas for the data sets we found.

### **Plans for next week:**

  Assuming our proposal gets approved, we will create a full outline of our project and begin implementing the actual structure of the graph that we will be using. If our proposal does not get approved, we will work to get one approved and then take the steps previously listed.

# Development Log (Date: 11/05/2022 -- 11/12/2022)

## Weekly Goals
-Resubmit project proposal 
-Create graph implentation / representation
-Parse data set

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Redraft of the proposal - All group members
CMake setup - Joe T
Graph implementation setup - Joe M and Lev S
Graph functions and data parsing - Joe T
Graph constructor test cases - Lev S and Joe M

## Problems Encountered 
- We were notified that Dijkstra's algorithm shouldn't be used on unweighted graphs so we had to find a way to add weights. 
- We initially encountered an issue with our adjacency list implementation which we were able to quickly resolve.
- We had to deal with being a group member down due to a family issue that Siddhant had. 

## Plans for next week
- Complete a full BFS traversal + test its implentation and runtime (without the visualization)
- Complete Dijkstra's algorithm + test for it

# Development Log (Date: 11/13/22 -- 11/20/22)

## Weekly Goals

- Implement Djikstra's Algorithm and BFS on our graph

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

- BFS - Joe M
- Worked on Djikstra's - Siddhant
- Optimized constructor runtime - Joe T

## Problems Encountered 

- Couldn't get Djistra's Algorithm fully working before the end of the week/

## Plans for next week

- Finish Djikstra's Algorithm
- Implement Stoer-Wagner Algorithm

# Development Log (Date: 11/28/22 -- 12/03/22)

## Weekly Goals

- Finish Djikstra's / start Stoer-Wagner

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

- Wrote main function - Joe T
- Worked on Djikstra's - Siddhant


## Problems Encountered 

- Weren't able to finish Djikstra's tests or Stoer-Wagner because of busy schedules

## Plans for next week

- Finish Djikstra's Algorithm tests
- Finish Stoer-Wagner Algorithm
- Work on BFS visualization
