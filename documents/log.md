# 10/31/2022 - 11/04/2022
**Weekly goals:**  
  Write project proposal  
  Write team contract  
  Create GitHub repository  
  
 ### **Tasks completed:**
  
  Created GitHub repo - Joe T
  
  Created and filled out team contract, project proposal, and log documents - Everyone

### **Problems encountered:**

  We had a little bit of trouble finding a data set that we could use for the ideas we had and thinking of ideas for the data sets we found.

### **Plans for next week:**

  Assuming our proposal gets approved, we will create a full outline of our project and begin implementing the actual structure of the graph that we will be using. If our proposal does not get approved, we will work to get one approved and then take the steps previously listed.
