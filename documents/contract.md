# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will meet at least once a week in person to check in on each other's progress and assess the overall project. We will also take this time to sit down and work on the project together for a couple hours and bounce ideas off each other. We won’t need someone to take notes, but everyone should be present at these meetings.
    
2. **Assistance** 

Our line of communication is through an iMessage group chat that we’ve created. Our expected response time is within 6h (at an upper bound), assuming the message was sent at a reasonable hour of day. 

3. **Respect** 

In terms of expression, all group members are free to speak their minds and share their opinions so long as they are not derogatory. All group members are to be respectful and considerate of the ideas of others. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

	We’ll divide up the work equally, and assign specific aspects of our implementation to different group members. We’ll do this based on people’s strengths and preferences. If a person encounters complications completing their assigned part, they’ll communicate this quickly and effectively to ensure their part will still be completed. As a group, we will then help this person out with their implementation in a manner that everyone is satisfied with.

5. **Time Commitment** 

When there is work that needs to get done, group members should be expected to put in at least 6h per week. If we can complete our goals for the week, the 6h minimum can drop. Prior time commitments are all in the form of personal involvements - these should be accounted for under the understanding of 6h (min) work weeks. We will all be understanding of new conflicts and do our best to compensate for group members for which it may be impossible to work 6h in a week.  

6. **Conflict Resolution** 



If disagreements arise, we will meet as a group and decide the best course of action from there. If we still cannot figure things out as a group, we will reach out to our mentor and course staff to resolve the issue. If one or more people are not completing their assigned tasks and not putting an effort in, the rest of the group will have a talk with them to identify the cause of this. The same goes for when one or more people are late to agreed-upon meeting times. If one or more people have family emergencies or excused absences from school, the rest of the group will pick up some extra work to make sure that everything is completed.
